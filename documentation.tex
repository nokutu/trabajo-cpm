   \section{Introduction}
   
   In this work, we have been developing a desktop application that will allow the user to book and pay for a Cruise.

   The application is suppose to read the information from a set of files and, at the end of the process, store the result in a text file, including all the necessary booking information, such us the user contact data and the cruise data.
   
   \section{Prototype}
   Our team's prototype did not change much between the initial design and the final one, just an issue relating with cash payment.
